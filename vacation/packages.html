                    <p>The pyramidal sweep of the Matterhorn pierces the sky in nearly every view from the Alpine town of Zermatt, one of Switzerland’s oldest and best-known mountain resorts. The town’s simple wooden chalets stacked up and down the valley sit amid most of the nation’s highest peaks, many exceeding 4,000 m (13,100 ft).
                    <br>
                    Mountaineering is the town’s chief activity, whether skiing, climbing, hiking or simply taking in the views. You can take easier walks along the area’s many mountain trails, both at low and high altitude. Or, board Europe’s highest open-air railway to see the Gornergrat and its glacier field.

            <h2>Edinburgh, Scotland Package</h2>       
            
                    <p>Dominated by a lofty castle and renowned for its mixture of high culture and cosmopolitan cool, Edinburgh is Scotland's historic capital. It's graced with fine architecture both in its medieval Old Town and Georgian New Town, a collection of great museums and a host of lively restaurants and bars, yet compact enough for you to explore on foot.
                    <br>
                    With historic buildings lining the handsome streets, strong connections to a host of literary giants and an internationally renowned festival, it's a cultural heavyweight protected as both a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a City of Literature. Despite its august credentials, the city has a vibrant, youthful character with a reputation for great nightlife and a sophisticated but down-to-earth air.

            <h2>Prague, Czech Republic Package</h2>       
            
                    <p>The ‘city of a thousand spires’, Prague’s architectural variety is reflected in its skyline, which is straight from the pages of a fairy tale. Cathedrals, monasteries, fortresses and castles rise above red-roofed buildings clustered along the banks of the Vltava River. Spanning the river is the Charles Bridge, commissioned in 1357 by Charles IV. You’ll pass stone statues of Catholic saints as you cross it.
                    <br>
                    Exploring Prague’s maze of cobbled lanes and alleyways, you’ll stumble across small courtyards, urban gardens and old-fashioned bars frequented by locals, eventually reaching the Old Town Square. Here you’ll find a riot of activity, from street performers in the spring and summer to Christmas markets in the winter. You’ll also see the 15th-century Astronomical Clock, whose hourly chime sets models of the Twelve Apostles in motion.
