        <h2>Client Testimonials</h2>
            <p>
            "If it weren't for Alyssa we would not have had an anniversary get away at all... let alone leave the country and experience a whole new world together! We are so busy between our business and our five children, and we unfortunately think of vacation after it's too late--celebrating our anniversary is no different. Starting with proactive outreach months earlier, asking a lot of questions to learn about who we are, and LISTENING, she built us the perfect simple get away! We loved the excursions and exploring restaurants (and the car waiting for us when we landed!). But what we loved most was a total surprise... the hotel was beautiful and Alyssa surprised us with a few Upgrades. Because of Alyssa and her upgrade, we woke up each morning in a select suite and sat on an exclusive deck overlooking the water, eating, drinking and just talking about life... and our next vacation!! Thank you Alyssa! We can't wait to see what she has in store for us next!" - Aelin and Rowan
